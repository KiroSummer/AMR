# Stacked AMR Parsing with Silver Data
This repository is for our paper "__Stacked AMR Parsing with Silver Data__", accepted by EMNLP-2021 Findings.
The code is built on the AMR-gs [code](https://github.com/jcyk/AMR-parser).
Please switch branch kamr-gr-2.4 for the latest code!

## Training
First, you need to check and rewrite the paths in **train.sh**.
And then, you should run the code as follows:
```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVISED=0,1 nohup sh ./train.sh ./data_dir 2>&1 train.log 2>&1 &
```

## Evaluation
With the trained models, you should rewrite the load path in **work.sh**.
And then, run the script to eval
```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVISED=0 sh ./work.sh
```

## Silver Data
We released the best performed silver data generated by Spring at [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17NnIl4CtLqtsZtzYIdYp3cI5qntTpEK0/view?usp=sharing).
If you need other silver data from Jamr or Tamr, please concat me.
